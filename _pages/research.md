### Who calls the shots? How financial incentives impact the adoption of a new health technology
Job Market Paper

In healthcare, the decision to adopt a product is a joint problem between the healthcare professional and the patient. At the same time, subsidies have become an important policy tool to increase the adoption of new health technologies.  Using data from a randomized control trial (RCT) in Kenya, this paper employs a structural model of patient demand and provider counseling to study the welfare effects to the patient from the introduction of demand and supply side subsidies for a new contraceptive technology. The experimental variation and structural model allows to study the channels that lead to the diffusion of the new health technology, including the role of provider counseling, provider financial incentives and altruism, and patientâ€™s preferences. Taken together, the results suggest that the provider's counseling role is key in increasing adoption of the new technology and making subsidy programs successful.

Should anti-poverty programs be targeted solely to the most deprived, or also to the most impacted households?

### Increasing access to contraceptive choice through targeted incentives
With [Maria Dieci](https://mariadieci.com/) and [Paul Gertler](https://www.paulgertler.com/)  

We investigate how targeted subsidies for long-acting injectable contraception and provider incentives impact initial uptake, sustained adoption, pricing and stocking decisions for contraceptive products in local markets, sales, and user health outcomes. Following prior work on the effectiveness of subsidies to promote the adoption of new technologies and experience goods, we aim to test if subsidies lead to sustained adoption of injectable contraception as well as to study possible mechanisms for continued usage (or lack of) such as learning, price anchoring, and information effects. We propose a market-level cluster randomized controlled trial in 140 pharmacies in Kenya to answer these questions. Patient subsidies and pharmacist incentives will be cross-randomized and compared against the status quo to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting sustained adoption.
